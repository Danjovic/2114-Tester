# 2114-Tester
Inexpensive Arduino based tool for testing 2114s

Th 2114 is a SRAM chip with 1024 x 4 bits used in many computers and some video games from the late 70's to mid 80s.
As many chips from that era it suffers from aging and is rather common for an equipment that is not working because of a bad RAM chip.

There are several low cost chip programmers/tester such as TL866 but find a cheap equipment that also support the 2114 it's harder to find that the 2114 chips themselves.

A quick solution is possible though, using cheap parts that are usually available in todays hobbyist parts bin: An Arduino board and a DIL socket.
